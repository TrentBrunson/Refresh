Pseudocode
Write a program that asks the user to enter a number with 27 digits or less. 
The convert that number into a set of three-digit numbers and associated 
place values. Display the results to the user.

1. get input and convert to string
2. get length of string
3. loop through number string
    a. how many 3-digit segments are ther? 
    b. howbigofaloop = n/3
    c. if condition:
        elif:
        elif:
        else:
    d. edge case: 0?
        if num == 0
            return "zero"
        while foo > 0:
            if num % 1000 != 0
if some length > 24
    septillion = True

            i += 1
