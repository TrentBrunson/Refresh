2.	Special Number - Write a program that can find a four-digit number that has the four digits reversed when multiplied by four. 
For example, rstu * 4 = utsr. The program should report the number to the user. 
1.	No input
2.	List of digits *4 â€“ [list of digits].reverse()

# PROGRAM:    Find a Special 4-digit Number
# PURPOSE:    Find a 4-digit number that when the digits are reversed, it's the
#             original number times 4.
# INPUT:      No user input.
# PROCESS:    Create two numbers to begin the process.
#             Convert the numbers to strings to compare digits. 
#             Access each index of the strings to compare.
#             When all conditions are met, exit the subroutine.
# OUTPUT:     number of e's in the input
# HONOR CODE: On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given 
#             nor received unauthorized aid on this academic work.
