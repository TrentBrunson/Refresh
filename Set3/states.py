'''
The data file "States.txt" contains the 50 US states 
in order they joined the union with one state per line. 
Write a program to read the file contents into a list. 
Then sort the list based on the number of consonants 
contained in the state name in ascending order. 
HINT: You will need to write a function to count 
the number of consonants in a word.

# PROGRAM:    State sorter
# PURPOSE:    Sort states by the number of consonants in their name.
# INPUT:      Text file ordered by date of admission to the union.
# PROCESS:    Get input; identify consonants; count consonants; create list of lists;
#             sort list of lists.
# OUTPUT:     Display new order on screen.
# HONOR CODE: On my honor, as an Aggie, I have neither given
